## Problem

When trying to restore image-based backup via bootable USB device, you may receive an error "A connection to the deployment share could not be made. The following networking device did not have a driver installed."
This may be a cause of network device driver absence or some failure during drivers import.

## Suggestions and Resolutions

#### Option #1

The easiest way to resolve issue is to burn new bootable USB and add necessary drivers on the pre-burn configuration wizard.

You can do it from the PC you were backing up or from any other Windows PC.

#### Option #2

In case you are not able to burn new bootable USB, following procedure will help you to add drivers without third party tools.

* Create temporary folder on your machine **C:\Temp**
* Copy **Boot.wim** file from **E:\SOURCES\BOOT.WIM** (bootable USB) to **C:\Temp**
* Copy drivers to **C:\Temp\mydrivers**

* Create **cloudre_mount** folder

* Mount the **wim** file

<pre class="language-powershell command-line" data-prompt="C:\" data-output="2-3">
<code>
Dism /Mount-Image /ImageFile:"C:\Temp\Boot.wim" /index:1 /MountDir:"C:\Temp\cloudre_mount"
</code>
</pre>

* Add your driver *yourDriverName.inf* to **cloudre_mount** folder

<pre class="language-powershell command-line" data-prompt="C:\" data-output="2-3">
<code>
Dism /Add-Driver /Image:"C:\Temp\cloudre_mount" /Driver:"C:\Temp\mydrivers\yourDriverName.inf"
</code>
</pre>

* Check, if the driver appeared in **cloudre_mount** folder (installed drivers should be listed)

<pre class="language-powershell command-line" data-prompt="C:\" data-output="2-3">
<code>
Dism /Get-Drivers /Image:"C:\Temp\cloudre_mount"
</code>
</pre>

* Unmount image and save changes

<pre class="language-powershell command-line" data-prompt="C:\" data-output="2-3">
<code>
Dism /Unmount-Wim /MountDir:C:\Temp\cloudre_mount /commit
</code>
</pre>

And that's it!<br />
This is how it should looks in command line:
